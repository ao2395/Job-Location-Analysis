# Ethics Statement

## Purpose

The **Job Salary Scraper and Analyzer** was built to provide users with insights into job markets by collecting and analyzing publicly available data from job listings. The tool is intended to assist job seekers, researchers, and professionals in understanding salary trends and job availabilities.

## Key Principles

1. **Transparency and Attribution**  
   All data collected is publicly available, but it’s important to attribute the job platforms (e.g., Indeed) when using this data for research, analysis, or publications. Salary estimates made by the tool (e.g., hourly to yearly conversions) are approximations and should be presented transparently.

2. **Respect for Platforms**  
   The tool should be used responsibly, in compliance with the terms of service of the websites being scraped. Avoid overloading servers or violating platform policies. Scraping should complement the platform’s purpose, not interfere with its business model.

3. **Data Privacy**  
   The tool does not collect personal data, focusing only on public job information. It should be used ethically for legitimate purposes such as job market research and not for unauthorized commercial use.

4. **Legal Compliance**  
   Users must adhere to relevant laws, including copyright and data protection regulations, when scraping data. Respect the legal frameworks of both your country and the website being accessed.
